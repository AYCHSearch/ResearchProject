This one-day class will introduce participants to the basics of
software project management with a particular focus on the sorts of
projects commonly found in research settings.  Participants should
have previously worked on programs containing thousands or tens of
thousands of lines of code, and be regular users of basic tools like
the Unix shell and a version control system.  Building on that
foundation, this course will discuss:

* how to choose an appropriate license
* how to use checklists and issue tracking systems to manage work
* why projects should rely on boring technologies
* what agile development is, and how to adapt it for research purposes
* how to turn a project into a community
