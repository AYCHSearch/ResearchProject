This one-day class will introduce participants to the basics of software project management
with a particular focus on the sorts of projects commonly found in research settings.
Participants should have previously worked on
programs containing thousands or tens of thousands of lines of code,
and be regular users of basic tools like the Unix shell and a version control system.
Building on that foundation, this course will discuss:

*   how to choose an appropriate license
*   how to use checklists and issue tracking systems to manage work
*   why projects should rely on boring technologies
*   what agile development is, and how to adapt it for research purposes
*   how to turn a project into a community
