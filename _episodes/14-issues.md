*   Issue-tracking tools are often called bug trackers
    *   Well-organized teams use them as a shared to-do list to manage everything
*   Every task is recorded as a separate ticket
    *   Unique ID
    *   One-line summary to aid browsing
    *   Status
    *   Owner (i.e., who's responsible)
    *   Full description that may include screenshots, error messages, etc.
    *   History: who created it when, how it has been modified
    *   Threaded discussion

Summary: Message file reader crashes on accented characters
Description:
1.  Create a text file called 'accent.msg' containing the message
    "PÃ¼mpernickel" (with an umlaut over the 'u').

2.  Run 'python mindcontrol.py --all --message accent.msg'

Program crashes with the message "No encoding for [] on line 1 of 'accent.msg'".
([] shows where a solid black box appears in the output instead of a printable
character.)

*   More sophisticated systems allow people to:
    *   Record dependencies between tickets
    *   Estimate how long work will take
    *   Record how long work actually took
*   Can be used to make the development lifecycle explicit
    *   I.e., only allow certain state transitions
    *   And notify interested parties of state transitions

*   Don't worry about any of this until people are actually filing issues
*   Key use: prioritization
    1.  What has to be done right now?
    2.  What should be done soon?
    3.  What can safely be left until later?
*   Criteria for decision:
    1.  How much do we need this?
    2.  How long will it take?
