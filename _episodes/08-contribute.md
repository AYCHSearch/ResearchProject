*   [Steinmacher][steinmacher-barriers]'s analysis of barriers to contribution
    *   How easy is it to get set up?
    *   How friendly was reception of first contribution?
*   So add the following to Noble's Rules:
    *   `LICENSE`: terms of re-use
        *   **Use a standard license** (preferably MIT)
    *   `CITATION`: how to cite the software
        *   Get a DOI for the software (see [Zenodo][zenodo])
    *   `CONTRIBUTING`: how to make contributions
    *   `CONDUCT`: project's social rules
* Simultaneously selfless and selfish
    * makes science easier to evaluate
    * makes life easier on your colleagues
    * makes it more likely that others will use (and **contribute to!**) your software
