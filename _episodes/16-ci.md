*   *Continuous integration*:
    *   Build and test code every time someone commits code
    *   Post results somewhere the team can see them
    *   If build or tests fail, send out notifications
*   Even better: build and test changes *before* they're merged
*   Developers still have to build the tests
*   Most widely used system is [Travis CI][travis-ci]
    *   Easy integration with [Github][github]
    *   Will run tests on multiple platforms and with multiple versions of tools

> ## Setting Up Continuous Integration
>
> 1.  Create a new Git repository on GitHub
>     and add a single Python file with one function that adds two numbers.
> 2.  Follow the steps in [this tutorial][python-travis-tutorial]
>     to set up Travis-CI testing of that function.
>
> How long did it take you to set this up?
