*   [Steinmacher][steinmacher-barriers]'s analysis of barriers to contribution
    *   How easy is it to get set up?
    *   How friendly was reception of first contribution?
*   treat every user as a potential contributor
*   add the following to Noble's Rules:
    *   `CONDUCT`: project's social rules
    *   `LICENSE`: terms of re-use
        *   **Use a standard license** (preferably MIT)
    *   `CITATION`: how to cite the software
        *   Get a DOI for the software (see [Zenodo][zenodo])
    *   `CONTRIBUTING`: how to make contributions
        *   Most important documentation is how to set up for development
*   Simultaneously selfless and selfish
    *   makes science easier to evaluate
    *   makes life easier on your colleagues
    *   makes it more likely that others will use (and **contribute to!**) your software
    *   ensures relevancy of your work when funding runs out or maintainer moves on
    *   more likely to impact traditional academic metrics (i.e. citations)

*   general communication
    *   small projects converge on one channel (i.e., issues, mailing list, Slack)
    *   strongly prefer email as lowest common denominator, threaded, and async
        *   aside: throttling
*   video conferencing
*   in-person meetings
