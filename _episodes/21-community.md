        *   "Someone mailed me your tweet about the Slack discussion so I filed a GitHub issue about updating the Google Doc. Wait, why are you crying?"
    *   Strongly prefer email for general discussion: ubiquitous, threaded, and asynchronous
    *   And discussion threads on issues for specific topics (to avoid overwhelming general channel)
*   Use video conferencing and in-person meetings to build community, not to share information
    *   People can read faster than you can talk
