title: "Choose Boring Technology"
teaching: 5
exercises: 10
questions:
- "How can I mitigate technology risk in my project?"
objectives:
- "Explain why projects should (mostly) rely on old, well-understood technologies."
keypoints:
- "Reduce risk by relying on tried-and-true technologies for most parts of a project."
---

*   Every project has a limited [innovation budget][mckinley-boring]
    *   Because every new technology introduces risk
    *   And risks interact non-linearly
*   Allow yourself one new tool or practice at a time
*   Strongly prefer things that have been around for a long time for everything else
    *   Limitations are known
    *   More people likely to know how to work with them
    *   "What's oldest will last longest" (proverb)

> ## Familiarity
>
> List the main dependencies of your project,
> then create a grid
> whose X axis is how long has each one has existed
> (weeks, months, years, decades)
> and whose Y axis is how long you have been using it
> (weeks, months, years).
> Which parts of the grid are uncomfortable for you?
> How many of your dependencies are in an uncomfortable part of the grid?
