*   Idea discussed in [McKinley's talk][mckinley-boring]
*   Every project has a limited "innovation budget"
    *   Because every new technology introduces risk
    *   And risks interact non-linearly
*   Allow yourself one new tool or practice at a time
*   And (strongly) prefer things that have been around for a long time
    *   Limitations are known
    *   More people likely to know how to work with them
    *   "What's oldest will last longest" (proverb)

> ## Familiarity
>
> List the main dependencies of your project,
> then create a 2x2 grid
> where the X axis is how long has each one has existed
> (weeks, months, years, decades)
> and the Y axis is how long you have been using it
> (same scale).
> How many of your dependencies are in an uncomfortable part of the grid?
