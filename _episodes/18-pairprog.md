*   *Pair programming*
    *   The *driver* does the typing
    *   The "navigator" watches and comments
    *   Every hour or so, the pair switches roles
    *   The navigator is effectively giving real-time code review
*   Benefits
    *   Spreads knowledge around
    *   Helps people pick up new skills
    *   And people are less likely to check Facebook every five minutes if someone else is working with them
*   In practice, most people don't want to do it all the time
*   Save it for:
    *   Onboarding
    *   Particularly hard tasks
    *   Socialization: an hour a day of pairing helps keep the team together
